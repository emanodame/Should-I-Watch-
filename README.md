My first project with C#, Should I Watch? This program allows you to input a movie or tv show and advices you if you should watch it. 

Software gets data from websites such as Metacritic and IMDB. If other people rated the movie very poorly, it will show on Metacritic and IMDB thus the program advising you not to watch the tv show or movie. Again, if a movie or is rated very highly, the program will advice you to watch it!

####**Version 1.0** 

- MySQL implementation that allows the input box to autocomplete the movie/tv show you're typing. The Database stores 1.5 million movie and television titles.
- Using NuGet package manager, I used the 'FluentMetacritic' package to get Critic Score,User scores and genres from Metacritic.
- Smooth looking design.
