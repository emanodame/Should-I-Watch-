My first project with C#, Should I Watch? This program allows you to input a movie  and advices you if you should watch it. 

Software gets data from websites such as Metacritic and IMDB. If other people rated the movie very poorly, it will show on Metacritic and IMDB thus the program advising you not to watch the  movie. Again, if a movie or is rated very highly, the program will advice you to watch it!

- MySQL implementation that allows the input box to autocomplete the movie you're typing. The Database stores 1.5 million movie titles.
