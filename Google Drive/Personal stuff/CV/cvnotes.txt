Computer technology is my passion.  I am always
looking for opportunities to enhance my expertise in computer sciences.
From the age of 16, I've been involved in the I.T sector. 
My passion escalated upon entering university, getting a 
first hand experience with multiple programming languages.
 
I am a self motivated individual with a vision to transform businesses and 
societies through technology.

Java quickly became my favourite language with me developing programs 
with the language and android applications. I hope to become a fully 
experienced Java programmer + other languages in the future.

I am currently looking for placement year   2016-2017.
